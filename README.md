Flow was a project started at a hackathon, that I've continued to build as I've learned more and developed further in the Android environment.

The basic idea is that the brain (espcially mine), isn't the greatest multitasker.

When you begin your day/studies/work you're mind can race between the multiple different things you need to do, preventing you from completing a single task to your best effort. Rather than brain dumping everything into a to-do list (which usually never get's done), Flow let's you create a defined workflow of tasks which you set the time for, allowing you to focus on only a single task at a time without having to worry what come's next.

Sometimes you repeat the same thing every morning.
#### Get to work
* 1. Plan my day, 10 mins
* 2. Check my calendar, 5 mins
* 3. Reply to E-mails, 15 minutes
* 4. Daily SCRUM Meeting, 20 minutes

Flow saves workflows and lets you repeat them as many times as you like. 

I hoping that by putting my code up here, other new android devs might be able to learn from it!

#### Note: for security reasons, v0.8+ code is not avaliable publicly. If you'd like to check out latest developments please send me a message :)
