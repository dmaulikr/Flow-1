Flow was a project started at a hackathon, that I've continued to build as I've learned more and developed further in the Android environment.

At a base level, the idea was to be able to apply the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to multiple tasks in a "to-do" type list. 

However, because of my personal style of needing to visualize things in order to best understand, I wanted to be able to SEE the actual tasks I would be completing rather than just a wall of text in a usual "to-do".

At the same time I wanted to be able to save these workflows and repeat them later in time

I hoping that by putting my code up here, other new android devs might be able to learn from it!
