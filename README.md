Flow was a project started at a hackathon, that I've continued to build as I've learned more and developed further in the Android environment.

The basic idea was to be able to apply the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to multiple tasks in a row.

However, I'm a visual person I wanted to be able to SEE the actual tasks I would be completing rather than just a wall of text in a usual "to-do".

At the same time I wanted to be able to save these workflows and repeat them later in time, whether your studying at the gym or just have a repeative morning ritual :).

I hoping that by putting my code up here, other new android devs might be able to learn from it!
