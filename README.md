# Flow Open Source

Being the first app I ever made, this is by far some of the least attractive code I've written, but maybe it can help you new developer to see what a functional app looks like (:

This repository contains code for a previous version of my app Flow on the Play Store (v0.7).

#### Note: if you do use the code here, it would be awesome if you could credit me! 

#### Why didn't you open source the most recent version? 
The most recent version contains code and actions that are security sensitive

# About 

Flow was a project started at a hackathon, that I've continued to build as I've learned more and developed further in the Android environment.

The basic idea is that the brain (especially mine), isn't the greatest multitasker.

When you begin your day/studies/work you're mind can race between the multiple different things you need to do, preventing you from completing a single task to your best effort. Rather than brain dumping everything into a to-do list (which usually never get's done), Flow let's you create a defined workflow of tasks which you set the time for, allowing you to focus on only a single task at a time without having to worry what come's next.

Sometimes you repeat the same thing every morning.
#### Get to work
* 1. Plan my day, 10 mins
* 2. Check my calendar, 5 mins
* 3. Reply to E-mails, 15 minutes
* 4. Daily SCRUM Meeting, 20 minutes

Flow saves workflows and lets you repeat them as many times as you like.
